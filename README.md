##Some ideas on how to improve view/data navigation
​
Main idea is to go in the direction of a simplified architecture, using concept found in the Flux architecture from Facebook, and the componentization of libraries like React. 
Of course it could be nice to have an immutable store too, to be used as an action and data handler, like Redux.

* [Flux architecture overview](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/overview.html)  
* [React.js (frontend js libraries with virtual dom)](http://facebook.github.io/react/)  
* [Redux - a container following the idea of Flux](http://redux.js.org/)  
* [Functional implementation of those concept in ClojureScript](https://github.com/omcljs/om/wiki/Quick-Start-(om.next))  

##TODO

Nearly everything : no store, no proper documentation, no example and lot of bugs or missing feature !
